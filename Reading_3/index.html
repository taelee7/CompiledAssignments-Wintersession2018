<p> As much as I agree with the concept that the barriers of privacy is waning through the progression of the internet, it isn’t entirely the exposure apocalypse everyone is proclaiming. Samuel Earle emphasizes on how privacy impedes profit so big companies try to extract the information from us using what we search. In a way, wouldn’t this concept satisfy our consumer side in the web? For example, if you have desires on a product or application to have specific details, your search history or contribution to forums will affect the developers’ decision on the direction to take for their business. If it ends up going your way, then both parties will be happy. I believe in exchange, there must be a limit to how much privacy can be extracted from the user. After all, if there is some privacy that you want to avoid, then there are methods to prevent them from being saved after all. Overall, I believe regulation and control from both parties will turn a privacy risk into a profit for those parties as long as these accords are met.
