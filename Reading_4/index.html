<p> We see the internet as a massive hub that operates the world we live in; the fascinating fact, however, is that it is less than half a century old. David Weinberger emphasized that the internet is a sandbox that has evolved its capability with user interaction. However, the freedom we have with interaction threatens the freedom the internet provides because of the negative effects it causes such as vulgar attitude and hate speech. After all, no one can hurt you behind a screen. As mentioned the internet is still developing; it may seem logical to find ways to restrict some capabilities it has to expel some of the toxic nature the internet caused. However, some claim that this will only affect the innocent and the guilty will find loopholes around these restrictions. So what are we supposed to do? Unfortunately, the solution is to take an over idealistic approach of spreading positivity. One act of positivity can spread as much as an act of toxic. The internet may be changed by corporate businessmen who believe it will improve the community, but it will be for nothing if they donâ€™t repel the toxic atmosphere it caused. So overall, what may happen to the internet in ten years? Honestly, the internet will continue to grow and affect our daily lifestyles even further. For example, twelve years ago, I would have never believed that a simple phone would have access to the internet almost on par with a computer. Well look at smartphones now. As we continue to develop things we believed impossible such as VR, the internet will power it and be supported as a branch of the growing entity known as the internet.
