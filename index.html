                  <p> I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, and jquery and used these skills to develop various projects. Additionally, I read and discussed with the professor and other students about articles related to the web and coding language history. </p>

                  </div>
                     <p>In this assignment, we had to choose a song's lyrics and decorate the website to fit the theme of the song. The song I chose is Emi Evan's Song of the Ancients. The song isn't a real language, but made up gibberish called Chaos language. I chose this song because there is no true meaning and it can be interpreted in various ways. When I listen to it, I can visualize a solo journey across a desert, uncertain what will be in the other side.</p>

                     <p>This project is about a common life event that humans experience: the 5 stages of grief. The menu is designed so the user is curious what comes after. In the actual stages, there are a series of circles that convey the thoughts of the person. Below, there is a brief summary of the stage the user is on and a right/left arrow navigator. This design makes a endless loop of the process of grief until you decide to escape using the back button on the top left.</p>

                     <p>We had to take an existing project and update it. I decided to update the 5 Stages of Grief. I applied various typefaces, animations, and color so that it conveys more expression in comparison to the last one. Additionally, I replaced the multiple of circles with a illustration of thought bubbles and a human. This way, there is a more straightforward process in looking at each stage of grief.</p>
