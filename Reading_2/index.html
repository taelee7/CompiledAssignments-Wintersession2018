<p> I don’t see why Web Design is anything special compared to any other design. It is like any other medium; it has phases, various techniques, and requires creativity to make it look good. Yet Alexander R. Galloway makes a good point that web design has been treated as an outcast in the field of design just because it doesn’t require something remotely close to a pen. This treatment is nothing different compared to the controversy towards digital art and photography. Those who claim to be professionals or critics claim that they feel artificial in comparison to traditional art.

I believe all designers and artist need to understand that design will evolve like everything else in this world. There will be newer mediums that will change how we see certain designs, but stubbornly sticking to the traditional methods will make you look like an obnoxious elitist. It’s not like previous methods were any better than the newer ones. For example, can we even believe for a second Java was more efficient than Javascript? Personally, I began to use Web Design more for my design portfolio and it is beneficial to me as a designer because it shows companies I can do more than just mess around with a stylus.
