<p> Code may be the foundation that keeps everything digital and in the real world together, but it is treated like every other product consumers enjoy then throw away. To keep the masses together, we demand efficiency to make our lives more convenient. Once code takes another mile step towards that efficiency, the previous “product” goes in the dumpster, like every other outdated product. I’m not saying that progression is a bad thing, but to be appreciative of the rate of progress code has brought us. For example, ten years ago, I would have never believed code would transform my large bulky desktop into a miniscule rectangle with a black screen.

Questions: What possible ways can code become more user friendly to new users?
Code can accomplish functions that required masses of people in the past. Are these accomplishments generally beneficial or harmful?
